Completed a job simulation by PWC Switzerland where I strengthened my Power BI skills to better understand clients and their data visualization needs. The key emphasis areas in the Call Centre Analysis included total calls answered, totalÂ issues resolved, call response time, call length, and overall customer satisfaction. The purpose was to provide an accurate picture of long-term trends in consumer and call centre agent behaviour. Created compelling visualisations demonstrating the KPIs, leading to data-driven decision-making.
